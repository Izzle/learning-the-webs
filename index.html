		<h2>Learning Web Development Again</h2>
		<img class="centered" src="images/alliance_logo.png" alt="Apple's logo: a 2D apple with a bite taken out of it.">
		<p>This is my test website for teaching myself web development. Currently I work at <a href="https://www.geeksquad.com">Geek Squad</a> as an Advanced Repair Agent: I fix computers. And, while I do enjoy my job and love my coworkers, there is a limit to how much you can learn about computer repair. </p>
		<p><strong>Growth</strong> is an important part of any profession and unfortunately the skill-ceiling of computer repair can be reached rather quickly. I've realized what I really enjoy is learning; I always want to be able to improve and learn. And web development is not only a broad field, but one of the fastest changing industries in the world. So here is my test page, the first step in a journey towards a new chapter in my life.</p>
		<ul> 
			<li>This is an unordered list</li>
			<li>It is denoted by <code>ul</code></li>
			<li>Line items are denoted with the <code>li</code> tag</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>This is an ordered list</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Open Sublime Text</li>
			<li>Learn to master your text editor with <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/courses/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-2">Tuts</a> or <a href="http://jennifermann.ghost.io/a-quick-guide-to-sublime-text/">this quick guide</a></li>
			<li>Practice</li>
			<li>Work hard</li>
			<li>Profit</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Resources</h2>
		<p>Here is a list of resources for learning web development</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://alistapart.com">A List Apart</a></li>
			<li><a href="">Codepen</a></li>
			<li><a href="">Smashing Mag</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Remember:</strong> When you get off work you're tired - you're not uninspired. Keep up the work, it <em>will</em> pay off one day. Its only been a few days and so much is already coming back to me.</p>

		<h3>The Box Model</h3>
		<p>Most HTML elements can be thought of as boxes. Recall that CSS is based on the <em>box model</em> of the DOM.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>padding</code> is the space around the content</li>
			<li><code>border</code> is the line that sits just outside the padding</li>
			<li><code>margin</code> is the space around the outside of the element ('padding' around the border)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Goals</h3>
			<p>It's important to have goals; and its equally - if not <em>more</em> - important to have deadlines. That's why I'm giving myself 1 year to get out of Geek Squad and to start my career in Web Development; I'll give myself until the end of 2017. Today is December 4th, 2016.</p>
			<p>As of this writing, that gives me 392 days and 23 hours to: learn web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.), build a portfolio, interview, and accept a job offer.</p>

		<h2>Git basics</h2>
		<p>After you've initialized your git repository, its pretty simple to add and save changes.</p>
			<h3>Git Add</h3>
			<p>The <code>git add</code> command adds changes you've made in the current working directory to a staging area. You can update existing files in the directory or add new files entirely. None of these changes are permanent until the next time you <code>commit</code> them.</p>
			<code>git add &lt;file&gt;</code>
			<p>Stages all changes to &lt;file&gt; to be added in the next commit.</p>
			<code>git add *</code>
			<p>Stages all changes in the current directory for the next commit. Be careful before using this catch-all statement.</p>
			<code>git add -p</code>
			<p>Starts an interactive staging session that prompts you to decide whether or not to keep a changes one chunk at a time.</p>
		
			<h3>Git Commit</h3>
			<p>The <code>git commit</code> command saves all the pending changes in the staging area to a new verison of the project. Having multiple verisons allows you to experiment freely without worrying about doing irreparable damage.</p>
			<code>git commit</code>
			<p>This will commit the changes you've made to a new snapshot. It will also open a text editor so you can add comments detailing the work you've done. <strong>Always</strong> comment the work you do - you will thank yourself later.</p>
			<code>git commit -m "&lt;comment&gt;"</code>
			<p>Commits the changes you've made, but saves your &lt;comment&gt; instead of opening a text editor</p>
			<code>git commit -a</code>
			<p>Commits all changes in the directory.</p>

			<h3>git push</h3>
			<p>After you've made your final commits locally, you should push your changes to the branch you are working on. On a community project you'd make a pull request, but on a repo that you own (such as this website) you can simply push directly to the branch with a...</p>
			<code>git push</code>
