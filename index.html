		<h2>Learning Web Development Again</h2>
		<img class="centered" src="images/apple_icon.png" alt="Apple's logo: a 2D apple with a bite taken out of it.">
		<p>This is my test website for teaching myself web development. Currently I work at <a href="https://www.geeksquad.com">Geek Squad</a> as an Advanced Repair Agent: I fix computers. And, while I do enjoy my job and love my coworkers, there is a limit to how much you can learn about computer repair. </p>
		<p><strong>Growth</strong> is an important part of any profession and unfortunately the skill-ceiling of computer repair can be reached rather quickly. I've realized what I really enjoy is learning; I always want to be able to improve and learn. And web development is not only a broad field, but one of the fastest changing industries in the world. So here is my test page, the first step in a journey towards a new chapter in my life.</p>
		<ul> 
			<li>This is an unordered list</li>
			<li>It is denoted by <code>ul</code></li>
			<li>Line items are denoted with the <code>li</code> tag</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>This is an ordered list</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Open Sublime Text</li>
			<li>Learn to master your text editor with <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/courses/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-2">Tuts</a> or <a href="http://jennifermann.ghost.io/a-quick-guide-to-sublime-text/">this quick guide</a></li>
			<li>Practice</li>
			<li>Work hard</li>
			<li>Profit</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Resources</h2>
		<p>Here is a list of resources for learning web development</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://alistapart.com">A List Apart</a></li>
			<li><a href="">Codepen</a></li>
			<li><a href="">Smashing Mag</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Remember:</strong> When you get off work you're tired - you're not uninspired. Keep up the work, it <em>will</em> pay off one day. Its only been a few days and so much is already coming back to me.</p>

		<h3>The Box Model</h3>
		<p>Most HTML elements can be thought of as boxes. Recall that CSS is based on the <em>box model</em> of the DOM.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>padding</code> is the space around the content</li>
			<li><code>border</code> is the line that sits just outside the padding</li>
			<li><code>margin</code> is the space around the outside of the element ('padding' around the border)</li>
		</ul>
