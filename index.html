		<h2>Learning Web Development Again</h2>
		<img class="centered" src="images/alliance_logo.png" alt="Apple's logo: a 2D apple with a bite taken out of it.">
		<p>This is my test website for teaching myself web development. Currently I work at <a href="https://www.geeksquad.com">Geek Squad</a> as an Advanced Repair Agent: I fix computers. And, while I do enjoy my job and love my coworkers, there is a limit to how much you can learn about computer repair. </p>
		<p><strong>Growth</strong> is an important part of any profession and unfortunately the skill-ceiling of computer repair can be reached rather quickly. I've realized what I really enjoy is learning; I always want to be able to improve and learn. And web development is not only a broad field, but one of the fastest changing industries in the world. So here is my test page, the first step in a journey towards a new chapter in my life.</p>

			<li>This is an unordered list</li>
			<li>It is denoted by <code>ul</code></li>
			<li>Line items are denoted with the <code>li</code> tag</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>This is an ordered list</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Open Sublime Text</li>
			<li>Learn to master your text editor with <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/courses/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-2">Tuts</a> or <a href="http://jennifermann.ghost.io/a-quick-guide-to-sublime-text/">this quick guide</a></li>

		<h2>Resources</h2>
		<p>Here is a list of resources for learning web development</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://alistapart.com">A List Apart</a></li>
			<li><a href="">Codepen</a></li>
			<li><a href="">Smashing Mag</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Remember:</strong> When you get off work you're tired - you're not uninspired. Keep up the work, it <em>will</em> pay off one day. Its only been a few days and so much is already coming back to me.</p>

		<h3>The Box Model</h3>
		<p>Most HTML elements can be thought of as boxes. Recall that CSS is based on the <em>box model</em> of the DOM.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>padding</code> is the space around the content</li>
			<li><code>border</code> is the line that sits just outside the padding</li>
			<li><code>margin</code> is the space around the outside of the element ('padding' around the border)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Git basics</h2>
		<p>After you've initialized your git repository, its pretty simple to add and save changes.</p>
			<h3>Git Add</h3>
			<p>The <code>git add</code> command adds changes you've made in the current working directory to a staging area. You can update existing files in the directory or add new files entirely. None of these changes are permanent until the next time you <code>commit</code> them.</p>
			<code>git add &lt;file&gt;</code>
			<p>Stages all changes to &lt;file&gt; to be added in the next commit.</p>
			<code>git add *</code>
			<p>Stages all changes in the current directory for the next commit. Be careful before using this catch-all statement.</p>
			<code>git add -p</code>
			<p>Starts an interactive staging session that prompts you to decide whether or not to keep a changes one chunk at a time.</p>
		
			<h3>Git Commit</h3>
			<p>The <code>git commit</code> command saves all the pending changes in the staging area to a new verison of the project. Having multiple verisons allows you to experiment freely without worrying about doing irreparable damage.</p>
			<code>git commit</code>
			<p>This will commit the changes you've made to a new snapshot. It will also open a text editor so you can add comments detailing the work you've done. <strong>Always</strong> comment the work you do - you will thank yourself later.</p>
			<code>git commit -m "&lt;comment&gt;"</code>
			<p>Commits the changes you've made, but saves your &lt;comment&gt; instead of opening a text editor</p>
			<code>git commit -a</code>
			<p>Commits all changes in the directory.</p>

			<h3>Git Push</h3>
			<p>After you've made your final commits locally, you should push your changes to the branch you are working on. On a community project you'd make a pull request, but on a repo that you own (such as this website) you can simply push directly to the branch with a...</p>
			<code>git push</code>
			<p>After pushing your commit, you'll be asked for your passphrase - just enter the passphrase and thats it! Once you've pushed the commit to somewhere like github the latest version of your project will be safe in the cloud!</p>

		<h3>Color</h3>
		<p>You can add color in CSS in many different ways. You can just use a color's name.</p>
		<code>color: black&#59;</code>
		<p>Color can also be expressed with hex code. Just as the Decimal system is a base-10 number system (ranging from 0-9) - Hexidecimal is a base-16 number system that uses letters to denote the last 6 digits (A=11, B=12.. F=16); you can read more about hexidecimal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">here</a>. Hex uses an RGB color system of 6 digits to represent color where each pair represents a color. For example, 0 represents the complete absence of color (black) and F represents the purest form of a color (red, green, or blue).</p>
		<code>#<span class="red">00</span><span class="green">00</span><span class="blue">00</span></code>
		<p>Another way you can represent color in CSS is with RGB values. The RGB for black is</p>
		<code>rgb(0, 0, 0)</code>
		<p>And the RGB value for white is</p>
		<code>rgb(<span class="red">255</span>, <span class="green">255</span>, <span class="blue">255</span>)</code>
		<p>Instead of using 6 hexidecimal digits like you did with hex color, when using RGB you specify each color's brightness with a number ranging from 0 to 255.</p>
		<p>When you used hexidecimal for color, we used two base-16 numbers for each color. Doing the math, 16 times 16 gives us 256 different variations. Using RGB, which starts counting from zero, we have the same number of possible values for color.</p>


		<h3>Goals</h3>
		<h3>ADD COUNTDOWN CLOCK HERE</h3>
			<p>It's important to have goals; and its equally - if not <em>more</em> - important to have deadlines. That's why I'm giving myself 1 year to get out of Geek Squad and to start my career in Web Development; I'll give myself until the end of 2017. Today is December 4th, 2016.</p>
			<p>As of this writing, that gives me 392 days and 23 hours to: learn web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.), build a portfolio, interview, and accept a job offer.</p>
