		<h3>Learning Web Development Again</h3>
		<img src="images/apple_icon.png" alt="Apple's logo: a 2D apple with a bite taken out of it.">
		<p>This is my test website for teaching myself web development. Currently I work at <a href="https://www.geeksquad.com">Geek Squad</a> as an Advanced Repair Agent: I fix computers. And, while I do enjoy my job and love my coworkers, there is a limit to how much you can learn about computer repair. </p>
		<p><strong>Growth</strong> is an important part of any profession and unfortunately the skill-ceiling of computer repair can be reached rather quickly. I've realized what I really enjoy is learning; I always want to be able to improve and learn. And web development is not only a broad field, but one of the fastest changing industries in the world. So here is my test page, the first step in a journey towards a new chapter in my life.</p>
